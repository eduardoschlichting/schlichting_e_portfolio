# Eduardo Schlichting - Portfolio :computer:

## Hello There! Welcome to my portfolio Repository! ðŸ‘‹

The project is currently being built by myself as my personal portfolio as a Designer and Front-end Web Developer. This is also part of the Final Integrated Project of the Fall 2021 term at Fanshawe College.

## The challenge :cold_sweat:

### Build a complete website making use of the following technologies:

* HTML / CSS / SASS
* JavaScript
* Vue.js
* AJAX
* PHP
* MySql

## Features :metal:

All the projects presented on the website are of my authoring and/or collaborative projects developed during school and interships.

## Observations

This is and will always be a working in progress, which means that the layout/projects here presented are subjected to change/update time to time.
